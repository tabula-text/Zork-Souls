### Welcome to Zork Souls – a text based Soulslike adventure.
 In Zork Souls, you find yourself in the shoes of an anonymous hero who ventures forth into an ever-dying land of cosmic horror, veiled in heavy fog and filled to the brim with endless lore. 
 
 Zork Souls is the lovechild of the classic text-based adventure Zork – developed by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling and released in 1977 for the PDP-10 mainframe computer – and Dark Souls – developed by FROMSOFTWARE and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, released in 2011.

 Zork Souls is a work in progress. The very first builds were taken from a freeCodeCamp course module on building an RPG game using JavaScript to construct a simple gameplay loop and a basic user interface.
